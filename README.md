This is the repository for our MyHome project for CS 360.

This project is made using [lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/).

The project uses sqlite3 for the database backend

To use the full functionality of the project, make a folder called "secret" in the style of the secret_example but with the real keys and stuff.
