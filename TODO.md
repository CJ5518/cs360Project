For Cole:

1. Make the pages look a little bit better

2. Add a navbar to the top, preferably as a lua widget, like the one that's currently there

It would have at minimum buttons to go to the dashboard and the service search/ the two calculators

3. Add home adding interface. Check the schema.sql for all the fields that need to exist

Add a button to the dashboard

Probably would just be a large form, check editUserInfoForm for how to do stuff like that, and try messing with the Homes model to make your life easier

Basically just do what was done for users but for homes




My section is mostly just small reminders for myself

For Carson:

Move a lot of the account stuff into a util, don't forget about the vendors
Cleans up some of the account stuff
